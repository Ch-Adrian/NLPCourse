# NLPCourse

These are labolatories for natural language processing course at AGH UST in Cracow.

## Main concepts learnt:
- extracting and dealing with Named entity recognition
- using differen language models as a generators, classificators or models to fill mask
- tokenization using SpaCy and leveraging levenshtein distance for searching
- question answering using RAG (retrieval augumented generation) with Qdrant vector database which benefits from dense representation
- abstractive question answering
- lexical search and dense retrieval model
- searching with ElasticSearach
- fine-tuning pre-trained model **allegro/herbert-base-cased** for classification
